This is a template for developing a new Spark-based application using sbt.

It includes a sbt runner script (Paul Phillips' `sbt-extras`) and a
project skeleton.  It also includes dependencies on Spark libraries.

To get started quickly, edit the source files in `src/main/scala` and run `./sbt compile`.
